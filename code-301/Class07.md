### What is node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side scripting to build dynamic web applications and perform various backend tasks.

Node.js provides an event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O operations, which make it lightweight and efficient, particularly for handling concurrent connections and real-time applications. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (such as Express.js, NestJS, and Socket.IO) that simplify building web servers, APIs, microservices, and other networked applications.

Additionally, Node.js has gained popularity for its versatility, as it can also be used for scripting, automation, and building desktop applications (using frameworks like Electron). It has become a foundational technology for modern web development, enabling developers to use JavaScript both on the client and server sides of web applications.

### In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is the core component of Google Chrome and many other web browsers. It's responsible for executing JavaScript code within the browser. 

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
In essence, Node.js as a JavaScript runtime provides an environment where developers can execute JavaScript code on the server-side, leveraging the language's capabilities beyond the confines of the web browser.

### What is npm?
npm stands for "Node Package Manager." It is a package manager for JavaScript and the world's largest software registry. npm is used primarily for managing dependencies in Node.js projects, but it can also be used for managing front-end dependencies and packages for other JavaScript environments.

### What version of node are you running on your machine?
v20.11.1

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?
10.2.4

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
npm install jshint

### What is node used for?
Overall, Node.js is a versatile and powerful platform that is used for a wide range of applications, from building web servers and APIs to developing real-time applications, command-line tools, and desktop applications. Its lightweight runtime, event-driven architecture, and rich ecosystem of modules make it a popular choice for modern web development and beyond.
