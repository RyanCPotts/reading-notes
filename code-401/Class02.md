### Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
Think of middleware like the intermediary between a request and a response in a Node.js and Express application. It's like a relay race where the baton (the request) gets passed from one runner (middleware) to another until it reaches the finish line (the response).

Middleware functions are kind of like checkpoints along the way. They can inspect and modify the request or response objects, perform specific tasks, or terminate the request-response cycle if needed.

For example, imagine you're organizing a party (your web application), and guests (requests) are arriving. Before they enter, you might have a bouncer (middleware) checking invitations. If they have one, they're allowed in (the request continues). If not, they're turned away (the request cycle ends).

In technical terms, middleware can handle things like authentication, logging, error handling, parsing incoming requests, and much more. It's a powerful tool for managing the flow of data through your application, ensuring everything runs smoothly and securely.

### Express the most popular __ __ ____.
Express is the most popular web framework for Node.js. It provides a minimalist and flexible set of features for building web applications and APIs. With its simplicity and robustness, Express has gained widespread adoption and a large community of developers contributing to its ecosystem. It's like the Swiss Army knife of web development in the Node.js world, offering everything you need to quickly create powerful and scalable web applications.

### Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
It means that Express doesn't enforce any specific architecture or coding style on you as a developer. In other words, it doesn't force you to structure your application in a particular way or use certain libraries or patterns.

Instead, Express gives you a lot of freedom and flexibility to design your application architecture according to your preferences and project requirements. You have the autonomy to choose the tools, libraries, and patterns that best suit your needs.

This flexibility is one of the reasons why Express is so popular—it allows developers to build applications in a way that makes sense for them, rather than being constrained by rigid rules or conventions. However, this freedom also means that you have to make more decisions and take more responsibility for the architecture and design of your application.

### What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
Overall, modularity promotes code organization, reusability, encapsulation, and easier maintenance, all of which contribute to the development of more robust and scalable software systems.

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?
10.2.4

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
npm install jshint

### TDD: Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
TDD stands for Test-Driven Development. It's a software development approach where you write tests for your code before you actually write the code itself.

Now, imagine you're building a house. Instead of starting with the construction right away, you'd sketch out a blueprint first. In TDD, those sketches are like your tests—they outline what you want your code to do. Then, you start building the code to match those sketches.

Now, why are these tests important, you ask? Well, think of them like safety nets. When you're building something, you want to make sure it's sturdy and reliable, right? Tests do just that. They help catch mistakes and make sure your code behaves the way you expect it to.

Imagine if you're baking a cake, and you have a recipe to follow. Testing is like checking the cake at different stages to make sure it's turning out the way you want. You wouldn't want to bake the entire cake only to realize it's burnt at the end, right? Tests help you avoid those burnt cakes in your code—they ensure your software works correctly from the very beginning.

So, in short, tests are important because they ensure your code is reliable, works as expected, and saves you from headaches down the road. They're like a guardian angel for your software, making sure it stays strong and dependable.

### CI/CD: What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
Continuous Integration (CI) brings several benefits to software development teams. Here are three key advantages:

Early Detection of Integration Issues: With CI, developers integrate their code changes into a shared repository frequently, often multiple times a day. Each integration triggers automated builds and tests. This frequent integration and testing process helps catch integration issues, bugs, or conflicts early in the development cycle, before they escalate into larger problems. By addressing these issues early on, teams can maintain a more stable codebase and reduce the time and effort required for troubleshooting and fixing problems later.
Faster Feedback Loop: CI systems provide rapid feedback to developers about the quality and correctness of their code changes. Automated tests run automatically after each integration, providing instant feedback on whether the changes pass or fail the tests. This quick feedback loop allows developers to identify and address issues promptly, improving overall productivity and enabling faster iteration on code improvements. Additionally, the immediate feedback encourages developers to write more reliable and maintainable code, as they can quickly see the impact of their changes.
Improved Collaboration and Communication: CI encourages collaboration and communication among team members. By continuously integrating code changes into a shared repository, team members are kept informed about the latest developments and can quickly identify potential conflicts or dependencies between their work and that of others. Additionally, CI pipelines often include features such as code reviews, automated notifications, and detailed build reports, which facilitate communication and collaboration among team members. This improved transparency and collaboration help ensure that everyone is aligned on project goals and contributes to a more cohesive and efficient development process.
