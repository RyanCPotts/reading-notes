### What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
 Imagine you're running a big company with lots of employees, each needing access to different parts of your office building. Some people need access to the finance department, others to the marketing department, and so on.

Now, managing who can go where can get pretty complicated, especially as your company grows. You don't want everyone wandering into areas they shouldn't be in, right? That's where Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) comes in.

Think of RBAC like giving out keys to your building. Instead of giving every employee their own set of keys to different rooms, you group them into roles based on their job responsibilities. For example, you might have a "Finance Team" role and a "Marketing Team" role.

Then, you assign each role a set of keys (or access permissions) to the rooms they need to do their job. So, the Finance Team gets keys to the finance department, while the Marketing Team gets keys to the marketing department.

Now, when a new employee joins or someone's role changes, you just give them the appropriate role (or set of keys). You don't have to mess around with giving them access to each individual room.

This makes managing who can go where a lot easier and more organized. Plus, if someone leaves the company or changes roles, you just take away their role (or keys), and they can't access those areas anymore.

So, RBAC helps keep your building secure and ensures that people only have access to the areas they need to do their job. It's like having a smart system for managing who can open which doors in your company's building!

### Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.

let's continue with the example of a company with various departments. Here's a simple Role/Permission hierarchy that could be implemented using RBAC:

Admin Role: This role has full access to all areas of the building. Admins are typically responsible for managing roles and permissions.
Department Manager Roles: Each department (e.g., Finance, Marketing, Human Resources) has a manager role. Department managers have access to their respective department's area as well as common areas like the cafeteria and meeting rooms.
Employee Roles: Employees are assigned roles based on their department and job responsibilities. For example:
Finance Team Role
Marketing Team Role
Human Resources Team Role
Visitor Role: Visitors or guests who need temporary access to certain areas of the building can be assigned a visitor role with restricted access.
Custom Roles: Depending on the organization's needs, custom roles can be created for specific job functions or access requirements.
Now, each role would be associated with a set of permissions or access rights. These permissions can include:

Access to Department Areas: Permissions to access specific departmental areas such as offices, workspaces, and storage rooms.
Common Area Access: Permissions to access common areas like hallways, elevators, restrooms, and meeting rooms.
Restricted Access: Restrictions on accessing sensitive areas like server rooms or executive offices.
Temporary Access: Permissions for temporary access to certain areas for maintenance or special projects.
For example, the Finance Team Role might have permissions to access the finance department area, common areas, and certain shared resources like printers and copiers. Meanwhile, the Marketing Team Role would have similar permissions but tailored to the marketing department's area and resources.

By organizing roles and permissions in this hierarchical manner, RBAC simplifies access management and ensures that employees have appropriate access to the areas and resources they need to perform their job duties while maintaining security and compliance.

### What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
Implementing RBAC in the example of a company with various departments involves several steps:

Identify Roles: Identify the different roles within the organization based on job responsibilities and access requirements. This could include roles such as department managers, team leads, regular employees, and visitors.
Define Permissions: Determine the specific permissions or access rights needed for each role. This includes access to physical areas (departments, common spaces) as well as any digital resources (files, databases) that may be relevant.
Assign Permissions to Roles: Associate the appropriate permissions with each role. For example, department managers might have access to their respective department's area, while regular employees might have access only to common areas.
Assign Users to Roles: Assign individual users to the appropriate roles based on their job responsibilities. This can be done manually or automatically based on job titles, department affiliations, or other criteria.
Implement Access Control Mechanisms: Implement access control mechanisms to enforce RBAC policies. This could involve physical access control systems such as keycards or biometric scanners for building access, as well as digital access controls for IT systems and applications.
Regular Review and Updates: Regularly review and update RBAC policies to ensure they remain aligned with organizational changes and evolving access requirements. This includes adding new roles as needed, updating permissions for existing roles, and removing or updating roles for users who change roles or leave the organization.
Training and Documentation: Provide training and documentation to employees on how RBAC works and their roles and responsibilities within the RBAC framework. This helps ensure that employees understand the access control policies and how to request access when needed.
By following these steps, organizations can effectively implement RBAC to manage access to resources in a structured and efficient manner, enhancing security and compliance while reducing administrative overhead.
