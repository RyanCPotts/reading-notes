## What is HTML and why do we use it?

## What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?
A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag.

## What is it called when you give an element extra information?
Attributes


## What is a semantic element?

A semantic element in HTML is an element that provides meaning to the content it contains, making it more understandable to both developers and web browsers. Semantic elements convey the structural and logical meaning of the content, which improves accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and maintainability of the code.

Examples of semantic elements in HTML include <header, <nav, <main, <article, <section, <aside, <footer, <h1 to <h6 for headings, <p for paragraphs, <ul and <ol for lists, <table for tabular data, etc.

Using semantic elements appropriately helps to organize the content of a webpage in a meaningful way, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code and for assistive technologies (such as screen readers) and search engines to interpret and navigate the content effectively.
