### What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
A real-world use case for the alt attribute in a website for a grocery store could be in describing images of products. When the grocery store website includes product images, using the alt attribute appropriately can enhance accessibility and provide important information for users, especially those who rely on screen readers or have images disabled.

### How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
Alt Attribute: Always use the alt attribute to provide descriptive text for images. This text should convey the purpose or content of the image. If the image is decorative and doesn't convey meaningful information, you can use an empty alt attribute (alt="") to indicate this to assistive technologies.

### Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
The `<figure>` element in HTML is useful when you have content that is referenced or explained within the context of the document. It's commonly used to encapsulate images, illustrations, diagrams, videos, code snippets, or other multimedia content along with their captions or explanations. 

### Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
Imagine GIF and SVG images as two different types of pictures, each with its own unique features and characteristics.

GIF Image:

GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. It's like a flipbook of images that play in sequence.
Think of it like a traditional hand-drawn animation in a book. Each page of the book shows a slightly different image, and when you flip through them quickly, it looks like the characters are moving.
GIF images are great for simple animations or short, looping sequences, like a waving flag or a bouncing ball.
They're easy to share and can be displayed on almost any device, but they're not great for detailed graphics because they can be grainy or pixelated.
SVG Image:

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. Instead of being made up of lots of tiny dots like a GIF, SVG images are made using mathematical formulas.
Imagine drawing a picture using lines, shapes, and colors on a piece of paper, and then being able to stretch or shrink that picture without it getting blurry or losing detail. That's what SVG images can do!
SVG images are great for things like logos, icons, or illustrations that need to look sharp and clear no matter how big or small they are.
They're also really good for accessibility because you can add things like text descriptions that help people who use screen readers understand what's in the picture.
In simpler terms, GIF images are like little movies made of pictures, while SVG images are like digital drawings that you can resize without losing quality. Each has its own special use, depending on what you want to do with your pictures!

### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
GIF because it's what I'm used to and I'm pretty sure it's standard.

### Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
Let's imagine you're painting a picture on a piece of paper. The foreground color is like the color of the paint you use to draw the main objects, like trees, houses, or people. It's the color that stands out and catches your attention.

On the other hand, the background color is like the color of the paper itself or the wall behind your painting. It's the color that fills in the space around the main objects you've drawn. It's important because it sets the mood or atmosphere of your painting, but it's not usually the main focus.

Similarly, in HTML, when we talk about foreground and background colors of an element, it's like talking about painting on a digital canvas. The foreground color is the color of the text or the main content of the element, while the background color is the color behind that content, filling in the space around it. They work together to make web pages look colorful and interesting, just like the colors in a painting make it come to life!

### Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

### What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
Readability: Choose fonts that are easy to read, especially for body text. Fonts with clear letterforms and appropriate spacing between characters (kerning) enhance readability. Avoid overly decorative or ornate fonts that may be difficult to decipher.

Accessibility: Ensure that the chosen fonts are accessible to a wide range of users, including those with visual impairments. Select fonts that have good contrast between the text and the background to improve legibility. Additionally, consider using scalable fonts that can be resized without losing readability.

Device Compatibility: Choose web-safe fonts or include fallback font families to ensure compatibility across different devices and browsers. Web-safe fonts are fonts that are widely available on most operating systems and devices, reducing the risk of font rendering issues.

Brand Consistency: Select fonts that align with the branding and design aesthetic of the website or document. Consistency in font choice helps reinforce brand identity and creates a cohesive visual experience for users.

Hierarchy and Emphasis: Use different fonts and font styles (e.g., bold, italic) to establish hierarchy and emphasize important content. For example, use a larger font size or a different font style for headings to distinguish them from body text.

Loading Performance: Consider the impact of font loading on page performance. Choose fonts from reputable sources or use web font services that optimize font delivery for faster loading times. Minimize the number of font variations and weights to reduce the overall file size.

Language Support: If your content is multilingual, ensure that the chosen fonts support the characters and diacritics required for the languages used. Use Unicode-compliant fonts to accommodate a wide range of languages and writing systems.

Licensing: Pay attention to font licensing agreements to ensure compliance with copyright and usage restrictions. Use fonts that are licensed for web use or obtain proper licensing if necessary to avoid legal issues.

### What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
font-size: This property sets the size of the text. You can specify the size using various units such as pixels (px), ems (em), or percentages (%). For example, font-size: 16px; sets the text size to 16 pixels. Larger values result in larger text, while smaller values result in smaller text.

font-weight: This property determines the thickness or boldness of the text. It accepts values such as normal, bold, bolder, lighter, or numeric values ranging from 100 to 900. The default value is typically normal, and bold makes the text thicker. For example, font-weight: bold; makes the text bold.

font-style: This property defines the style of the text, such as italic or normal. It accepts values like normal, italic, and oblique. The default value is usually normal. For example, font-style: italic; makes the text italicized.
