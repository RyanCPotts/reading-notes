# Class 28 - Component Lifecycle / useEffect Hook

### What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?
The useEffect hook provides a versatile way to handle side effects, replacing many lifecycle methods previously used in class components.

### How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?
The useEffect hook's logic interacts with the component by allowing you to run side-effect code at specific points in the component's lifecycle, manage state and prop changes, and clean up resources efficiently. This makes it a powerful tool for handling a wide range of side effects in functional components.

### What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?
The return value from the effect’s logic function, i.e., the cleanup function, is essential for:

Managing resources efficiently.
Preventing memory leaks.
Ensuring the component behaves correctly and consistently.
Handling changes in dependencies gracefully.
By providing a cleanup function, you ensure that any side effects introduced by the effect are properly cleaned up, maintaining the stability and performance of your React application.
