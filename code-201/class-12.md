### Explain what the getContext() method does.

The getContext() method is a crucial method used in HTML5's <canvas> element. It is used to obtain the rendering context and thus allows developers to draw and manipulate graphics, text, and images on the canvas dynamically using JavaScript.

The getContext() method is called on the <canvas> element and takes one argument, which is a string indicating the type of rendering context desired.

Rendering Context Types:
The contextType argument specifies the type of rendering context to be obtained. There are several supported context types, each offering different capabilities for drawing and manipulation:

2d: Returns a 2D rendering context, which allows for drawing 2D shapes, text, images, and applying styles and transformations.
webgl or experimental-webgl: Returns a WebGL rendering context, which enables high-performance 3D graphics rendering using the WebGL API.
webgl2: Returns a WebGL 2 rendering context, an updated version of WebGL with additional features and enhancements.
bitmaprenderer: Returns a bitmap renderer context, which is used for offscreen rendering and can be transferred to an <image> or <video> element.
Usage:
After obtaining the rendering context using getContext(), developers can use the returned context object (context) to draw and manipulate graphics on the canvas. This includes functions and properties for drawing shapes, paths, text, images, gradients, patterns, transformations, and more.

Overall, the getContext() method is essential for working with the <canvas> element in HTML5, as it provides access to the rendering context necessary for drawing and manipulating graphics programmatically using JavaScript.
