# Class 05 Linked Lists

Imagine a linked list in a grocery store as a line of people waiting to check out their items at the cash register.

Nodes: Each person in the line represents a node in the linked list. They are standing in a specific order, one after the other.
Data: Each person (node) carries their groceries (data) that they want to buy. This data could be anything they picked up from the store, like apples, milk, bread, etc.
Pointers: Now, imagine each person holding hands with the person standing behind them. This holding of hands represents the pointers in the linked list. It's the connection that defines the order of the line. The first person holds the hand of the second person, the second person holds the hand of the third person, and so on.
Head: The first person in line is like the head of the linked list. They are the starting point, and you can easily find them because they're at the front of the line.
Tail: The last person in line is like the tail of the linked list. They're at the end, and there's nobody behind them.
Traversal: To traverse the linked list (i.e., go through each person/node), you start at the head of the line and follow the hands (pointers) until you reach the end of the line.
Adding/Removing: Adding a person to the line means inserting a new node into the linked list. Removing a person means deleting a node from the list. When adding, you make the previous last person (node) let go of the hand of the current last person and hold the hand of the new person. When removing, you skip a person in the line by making the previous person let go of the hand of the person being removed and hold the hand of the person after them.
Linked lists are useful data structures because they allow for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.
