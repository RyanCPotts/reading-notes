### Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

Parsing in the browser is like following a recipe step by step – first understanding the ingredients and their arrangement (HTML), then adding decorations and colors (CSS), and finally bringing the meal to life with interactive elements (JavaScript).

### How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

Literals is the most common way to create strings and numbers in JavaScript, as it's simpler and more concise. The constructor approach is less common and generally used in specific cases where you need to create objects with additional methods and properties, such as when dealing with string or number objects.

### What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, a variable is a named storage location that holds data or values. It's like a container where you can store information and refer to it by its name. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data dynamically within your code.

### What is an HTML attribute?

Attributes provide additional information about elements.

### Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.

Start Tag: Think of the start tag as the opening of the container. It's like saying "Hey, this is where our container begins!"

Attributes: Attributes are like special labels or tags you can stick on the container. They give additional information about what's inside the container. For example, if it's a link, an attribute might say where the link goes when you click on it.

Content: The content is the stuff you put inside the container. It could be text, pictures, or even more containers (nested elements).

End Tag: The end tag is like the closing of the container. It says, "Okay, we're done with what's inside this container."

### What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?

In essence, <article> is for standalone content, while <section> is for organizing content into logical sections within a webpage.

### What Elements does a “typical” website include?

Header: The top part of the webpage, often with the website logo and navigation menu.

Navigation Menu: Links that help you move around the website easily.

Main Content: The main part of the webpage where you find the information you're looking for.

Images and Videos: Pictures and videos that help illustrate the content.

Forms: Areas where you can input information, like filling out a contact form or logging in.

Footer: The bottom part of the webpage, usually with extra links and information, like contact details or legal stuff.

### How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

Imagine you're in a library looking for a specific book. You know the title, author, and what the book is about. Metadata is like the information you use to find that book.

Title Tag: This is like the title of the book. It tells search engines what your webpage is about. Just like a catchy book title grabs your attention, a good title tag can make your webpage stand out in search results.

Meta Description: Think of this as the blurb on the back cover of the book. It gives a brief summary of what the webpage is about. A compelling meta description can convince people to click on your webpage when they see it in search results.

Headers (H1, H2, etc.): These are like chapter titles in a book. They organize the content on your webpage and give search engines a better understanding of what each section is about.

Keywords: Keywords are like the index at the back of the book. They're the words and phrases people might use when searching for information online. Including relevant keywords in your metadata helps search engines connect your webpage with what people are looking for.

URL Structure: The URL of your webpage is like the address of a book in the library. A clear, descriptive URL can help both search engines and people understand what your webpage is about.

Overall, metadata plays a crucial role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) by providing search engines with information about your webpage's content. Just like a well-crafted book title and description help people find and choose books in a library, effective metadata helps your webpage rank higher in search results and attract more visitors.

### How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

These <meta> tags are placed in the <head> section of your HTML document, where they provide additional information about the webpage to browsers and search engines. Just like adding labels to a box helps people know what's inside, using <meta> tags helps computers understand and categorize your webpage's content.

### What is the first step to designing a Website?

Decide the purpose of the website.

### What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?

What is the best way to achieve the goal of the website?

### Why should you use an H1 element over a SPAN element to display a top level heading?

While both H1 and SPAN elements can be styled to look like headings, using H1 conveys semantic meaning, establishes hierarchy and structure, ensures consistency in styling, improves readability and usability, and enhances accessibility. Therefore, it's best practice to use H1 for top-level headings in HTML documents.

### What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

Establishes hierarchy and structure, ensures consistency in styling, improves readability and usability, and enhances accessibility.
