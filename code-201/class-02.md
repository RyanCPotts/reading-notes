### Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Establishes heirarchy and structure.T

### How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

Six.

### What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?

Superscript and subscript for things like mathmatical and chemical formulas.

### When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

Title.

### What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

Inline styles, Internal Styleshet, External Stylsheet.

### Why should we avoid using inline styles?

It makes it harder to maintain and update styles because they are scattered throughout the HTML document.

### Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

What is representing the selector? `h2`
Which components are the CSS declarations? black, 5px
Which components are considered properties? color, padding

### What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

String.

### List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

Arithmetic Operators: These operators perform mathematical calculations on numerical values. Examples include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).

Assignment Operators: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Examples include the simple assignment operator (=), as well as compound assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, and /=.

Comparison Operators: These operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (true or false). Examples include equal to (==), not equal to (!=), strict equal to (===), strict not equal to (!==), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).

Logical Operators: Logical operators are used to combine or manipulate Boolean values. Examples include logical AND (&&), logical OR (||), and logical NOT (!).

These operators are fundamental for performing various operations and making decisions in JavaScript programs.

### Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.

One real-world problem that could be solved with a function in a grocery store is optimizing the checkout process by calculating the total cost of items for customers.

### An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.

True.

### What is the use of an else if?

Imagine you're trying to decide what to wear based on the weather outside. You might have different outfits for different conditions. An "else if" statement allows you to consider each condition in order and choose the appropriate outfit accordingly.

For example:

If it's sunny, wear shorts and a t-shirt.
Else if it's cloudy, wear jeans and a sweater.
Else if it's raining, wear a raincoat and boots.
Else, if none of the above conditions match, just wear whatever you feel comfortable in.

### List 3 different types of comparison operators.
The || operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
Strict equal to (===): This operator checks if two values are strictly equal to each other, meaning they are not only equal in value but also of the same data type. It returns true if the values are strictly equal, and false otherwise. Unlike the equal to (==) operator, the strict equal to (===) operator does not perform type coercion.

Less than or equal to (<=): This operator checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand. It returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand, and false otherwise.

Logical AND (&&): This operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a logical AND operation. It returns true if both conditions are true, and false otherwise. For example, condition1 && condition2 will evaluate to true only if both condition1 and condition2 are true.

### What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?

The && operator returns true if both of the operands are true.
The || operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
