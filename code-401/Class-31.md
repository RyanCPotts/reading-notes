# Class 31 - Context API

### When structuring state with the Context API in React, there are several best practices to ensure that your state management is effective, maintainable, and scalable. Here are five key principles:

Keep Context Size Small and Specific:

Principle: Only store the data that needs to be globally accessible in the context. Avoid placing all your state in a single context, as it can lead to unnecessary re-renders and complex dependencies.
Implementation: Create multiple, small contexts for different parts of your application state. For example, you could have separate contexts for user authentication, theme settings, and application data. This way, only the components that need a specific piece of state will subscribe to the relevant context.
Minimize Context Value Changes:

Principle: Avoid frequent changes to the context value, as it triggers re-renders for all components consuming the context.
Implementation: Use local component state for values that change frequently. For instance, if you have a search term that updates with every keystroke, keep it in the local state of the search component rather than in the global context.
Use Context for State That Is Truly Global:

Principle: Only use context for state that needs to be accessed by multiple components across your application, regardless of their position in the component tree.
Implementation: Examples of global state might include user preferences, authentication status, or theme settings. For localized state, prefer passing props or using component-level state.
Avoid Overusing Context:

Principle: Don't use context as a replacement for all forms of state management. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution and should be used judiciously.
Implementation: Combine context with other state management tools and patterns as needed. For example, use React's useReducer or third-party libraries like Redux for complex state logic, especially when state interactions become intricate.
Abstract Context Logic for Reusability:

Principle: Encapsulate the logic for managing context state within custom hooks or context providers to promote reusability and separation of concerns.
Implementation: Create custom hooks that provide context values and actions. For instance, if you have a theme context, create a useTheme hook that provides the current theme and a function to toggle it. This helps keep your components clean and focused on their primary responsibilities.
Summary
To effectively structure state with React's Context API, aim to create small, specific contexts, minimize context value changes to reduce re-renders, use context for truly global state, avoid overusing context by supplementing it with other state management tools, and encapsulate context logic into reusable hooks. By adhering to these principles, you can maintain a clear and efficient state management architecture in your React applications.

### What problem do Contexts aim to solve?
The Context API in React is a powerful tool that addresses the challenges of prop drilling, managing global state, and simplifying state sharing across components. It helps improve code maintainability, reduce redundant code, and create a cleaner and more efficient architecture for state management in React applications.

### What is one technique to try before useContext?
Before resorting to the useContext hook in React for state management and data sharing, one technique you might consider is lifting state up. Lifting state up involves moving the shared state to the closest common ancestor of the components that need access to that state. This can often be a simpler and more straightforward approach for managing state between a few related components, and it helps avoid the complexities and potential pitfalls associated with using context for smaller, more localized state management needs.

### What hook complements useContext for complex applications?
For complex applications, the useReducer hook is often used in conjunction with useContext to manage state more effectively. While useContext allows you to share state across various components, useReducer provides a way to handle complex state logic and actions in a more structured and scalable manner.
