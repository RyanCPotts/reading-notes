### How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)
In a React application, managing state can become complex as the app grows, especially when different parts of the app need to share and update data. This is where useReducer and useContext come into play, working together to simplify state management in a way that's more organized and easier to maintain. Think of useReducer as a powerful tool that helps you manage the state of your app in a predictable way, similar to how a bank handles transactions. You have a current state (like your bank balance) and you can dispatch actions (like deposits or withdrawals) to change this state in a controlled manner. The useReducer hook takes in a reducer function, which is like a set of instructions that tells the app how to update the state based on different actions, and an initial state, which is your starting point.

Now, when you combine this with useContext, you take state management to the next level. useContext acts like a public bulletin board where different parts of your app can post and read updates. By using useContext, you can create a central state that is accessible from any component within your app without the need for "prop drilling" â€“ passing data through multiple levels of components. For example, you might create a UserContext that holds the current user's information. Components anywhere in your app can then access and update this information by referring to the UserContext, thus maintaining a single source of truth. By using useContext in combination with useReducer, you essentially have a centralized state management system that is both powerful and straightforward, allowing your app to be more efficient and your code to be cleaner and more organized. This makes it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand and work with the app's architecture, as changes to the state are handled in a consistent and predictable way.
