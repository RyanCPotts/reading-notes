# Class 16 - AWS and Cloud

### What is an EC2 Instance?
An EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. It provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud, allowing developers to run applications on virtual machines without investing in physical hardware.

### Name 2 use cases for EC2.
1. Web Hosting and Application Deployment
Use Case: Hosting Websites and Web Applications

Description: EC2 instances are widely used to host websites and deploy web applications. By leveraging the scalability and flexibility of EC2, businesses can ensure their web applications can handle varying levels of traffic and provide a reliable user experience.

Example:

E-commerce Platforms: An online retail store can use EC2 instances to run its web servers, application servers, and database servers. During peak shopping seasons, such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday, the business can scale up the number of instances to handle the increased traffic and then scale down after the peak period to save costs.
Content Management Systems (CMS): A company can deploy a CMS like WordPress on EC2 instances to manage and serve web content. The flexibility of EC2 allows for easy updates, security patches, and the ability to handle traffic spikes.
2. Big Data Processing and Analysis
Use Case: Processing and Analyzing Large Data Sets

Description: EC2 instances are used to perform big data processing tasks, such as analyzing large datasets, running machine learning models, and performing data transformations. EC2 provides the computational power needed to handle these intensive tasks efficiently.

Example:

Data Warehousing: A company can use EC2 instances in conjunction with Amazon Redshift or Hadoop clusters to process and analyze massive amounts of data collected from various sources. This can include customer data, transaction logs, and social media interactions.
Machine Learning: Data scientists can use EC2 instances with GPUs to train machine learning models on large datasets. Once the models are trained, they can be deployed on EC2 instances to make real-time predictions or decisions based on new data.
These use cases illustrate the versatility of EC2 in handling both web-based applications and data-intensive tasks, providing scalable and flexible computing resources to meet various business needs.

### Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.
Flexibility and Control Over Infrastructure
Reason: Enhanced Flexibility and Control Over Infrastructure

Explanation: Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) offers greater flexibility and control over the underlying infrastructure compared to services like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or Render.com. This is particularly important for organizations with specific infrastructure requirements, custom networking setups, or complex deployment needs.

With ECS, you have full control over the configuration of your containerized applications, including the ability to:

Customize the underlying EC2 instances: Choose instance types, specify CPU and memory configurations, and optimize the instances for your specific workload.
Network Configuration: Integrate with Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to have fine-grained control over network settings, security groups, and subnet configurations. This is crucial for applications requiring stringent security measures or custom network architectures.
Scaling and Load Balancing: Implement custom auto-scaling policies and use Amazon Application Load Balancers (ALB) or Network Load Balancers (NLB) to distribute traffic efficiently and manage high availability.
Advanced IAM Integration: Leverage AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for detailed permissions and security policies, ensuring that your applications run with the least privilege necessary.
In contrast, services like Heroku, DigitalOcean, and Render.com typically offer more abstraction and simplicity, which is great for ease of use but may limit your ability to fine-tune and customize the environment to the same extent as ECS.

Example:
An enterprise application requiring specific compliance and security standards might use ECS to ensure all network traffic is routed through encrypted channels, enforce custom security policies, and use dedicated hardware if necessary. This level of control is often harder to achieve with more abstracted PaaS solutions.

Burstable Performance: Similar to T2 Micro, T2 XL instances also have burstable CPU capabilities with CPU credits.
Cost: Higher cost than T2 Micro, but still relatively affordable compared to non-burstable instances with similar resources.
Use Cases: Suitable for medium to large-scale applications that require more memory and CPU capacity, such as larger databases, web servers, and application servers that experience variable workloads.

### Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
Imagine you have a bunch of math problems you need to solve on a piece of paper. Each time you pick up your pencil, start working on a problem, and put your pencil down when you're done, that's like completing one "compute cycle".

Now, let's relate that to computers:

A "compute cycle" for a computer is like a single operation or task it performs. Just like you solve one math problem at a time, a computer does one thing at a time too, like adding two numbers together, checking if a password is correct, or displaying a picture on the screen.

So, every time a computer does one of these tasks, it's going through a "compute cycle". And just like you can solve many math problems one after another, a computer can do many compute cycles in a row, quickly working through a list of tasks to get things done.
