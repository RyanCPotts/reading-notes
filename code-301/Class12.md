### In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
HTTP status codes are standardized codes returned by web servers in response to a client's request. They provide information about the outcome of the request. Here's a breakdown of the major groups of HTTP status codes:

100's (Informational):

These status codes are informational responses indicating that the request has been received and understood and that the process is continuing.
Examples:
100 Continue
101 Switching Protocols
102 Processing (WebDAV; RFC 2518)
200's (Success):

These status codes indicate that the request was received, understood, and processed successfully.
Examples:
200 OK
201 Created
204 No Content
206 Partial Content
300's (Redirection):

These status codes indicate that the client needs to take further action to complete the request.
Examples:
301 Moved Permanently
302 Found
304 Not Modified
307 Temporary Redirect
400's (Client Error):

These status codes are returned when the client appears to have erred.
Examples:
400 Bad Request
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
405 Method Not Allowed
500's (Server Error):

These status codes indicate problems with the server processing the request.
Examples:
500 Internal Server Error
501 Not Implemented
503 Service Unavailable
504 Gateway Timeout
Understanding these status codes can help diagnose issues encountered while interacting with web servers, aiding in troubleshooting and improving user experience.

### What is a status code 202?
Status code 202 is part of the 200 range, specifically categorized as a "Success" status code. It stands for "Accepted".

When a client sends a request to a server, the server may not be able to complete the request immediately. In such cases, it might accept the request for processing but defer the actual processing to a later time. In response, it can return a status code 202 to inform the client that the request has been accepted and will be processed asynchronously.

The client should not expect the request to be completed immediately. Instead, it may need to check back later for the results or status of the request.

Here's the definition of status code 202:

202 Accepted: The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not be acted upon eventually, and may be disallowed when processing occurs.

### What is a status code 308?
Status code 308 is part of the 300 range, specifically categorized as a "Redirection" status code. It stands for "Permanent Redirect".

The 308 Permanent Redirect status code indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), and any future references to this resource should use one of the enclosed URIs. It's similar to the more commonly known 301 Moved Permanently status code, but with the distinction that it maintains the same HTTP method used in the original request when redirecting.

Here's the definition of status code 308:

308 Permanent Redirect: The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource should use one of the enclosed URIs. Clients with link editing capabilities should automatically re-link references to the target resource to one or more of the new references sent by the server, where possible.

### What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

If an update operation is performed successfully on the server but doesn't return any data to the client, you can use the HTTP status code 204 No Content.

Here's why:

204 No Content: This status code indicates that the server has successfully fulfilled the request, but there is no content to send in the response payload body. It is often used in cases where the client doesn't need to receive any content in response to the request, but the request was successful in updating or modifying the resource on the server.
Using the 204 status code in this scenario informs the client that the update operation was successful without cluttering the response with unnecessary data. It also allows the client to differentiate between successful updates that don't return data and other types of responses.

### What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
If a resource used to exist but no longer does, you would typically use the HTTP status code 410 Gone.

Here's why:

410 Gone: This status code indicates that the requested resource is no longer available at the server and that no forwarding address is known. It is similar to a 404 Not Found status code but implies that the resource is intentionally gone and will not be available again. Unlike a 404 response, which might indicate a temporary condition, a 410 response should be treated as a permanent condition.
Using the 410 status code informs the client that the requested resource used to exist but has been intentionally removed and is not expected to be available again in the future. This helps prevent the client from repeatedly attempting to access the resource.

### What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
The "Forbidden" status code in HTTP is represented by the code 403. It indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. This status code is typically returned when the server understands the client's request, but the server is refusing to fulfill it because the client lacks proper authorization or permission to access the requested resource.

In essence, the server is saying "You're not allowed to access this resource, and your credentials or lack thereof don't give you permission to do so."

Here's the definition of the 403 Forbidden status code:

403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it. This status code is similar to 401, but authentication is not sufficient to gain access.
Common reasons for receiving a 403 Forbidden status code include:

Lack of proper authentication credentials.
Insufficient permissions for the client to access the resource.
Access to the resource is restricted by the server or some other authority.

### Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
Pulling the MongoDB database string out of the server and putting it into the .env file is a common practice in web development, especially in projects that follow the principles of Twelve-Factor App methodology or use environment variables for configuration management. There are several reasons for doing this:

Security: Storing sensitive information like database connection strings directly in the server-side code can pose security risks, especially if the code is shared or version-controlled publicly. Placing such information in environment variables, like the .env file, provides an additional layer of security because these files are often excluded from version control and are not accessible to unauthorized users.

Configuration Management: Keeping configuration settings, including database connection strings, in a separate configuration file or environment variables makes it easier to manage and update these settings across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). Developers can change the database configuration without modifying the codebase, which reduces the risk of errors and simplifies deployment processes.

Scalability and Flexibility: By using environment variables, developers can easily switch between different databases or database configurations without modifying the code. This flexibility is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple developers work on the same project or when deploying the application to different environments with varying configurations.

Separation of Concerns: Separating configuration settings from the application code adheres to the principle of separation of concerns. It improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability by clearly distinguishing between application logic and configuration details.

Best Practices: Following best practices in software development, such as using environment variables for configuration management, helps ensure the robustness, security, and maintainability of the application over time.

Overall, storing sensitive information like database connection strings in environment variables, particularly in a .env file, enhances security, simplifies configuration management, and promotes good coding practices in web development projects.

### What is middleware?
Middleware is a software component that sits between an application's core logic and the underlying operating system or other software components, facilitating communication and data processing between them. In web development, middleware often refers to software components that intercept and handle HTTP requests and responses in a web application's request-response cycle.

Here are some key points about middleware:

Intermediary Functionality: Middleware acts as an intermediary layer between different components of an application, allowing them to communicate and interact with each other without being directly connected. It can intercept requests before they reach the application's core logic and process responses before they are sent back to the client.

Request-Response Handling: In the context of web development, middleware typically handles HTTP requests and responses. It can perform various tasks such as logging, authentication, authorization, input validation, session management, error handling, and more. Middleware functions can execute code before or after the main application logic runs, enabling them to modify request or response data as needed.

Chain of Responsibility: Middleware functions are often organized into a chain of handlers, where each middleware component in the chain has the opportunity to process the request or response and pass control to the next middleware in the chain. This pattern allows developers to modularize and reuse middleware components, making the application more maintainable and extensible.

Framework Integration: Many web frameworks provide built-in support for middleware, allowing developers to easily incorporate middleware into their applications. Middleware functionality can be added to the application's pipeline or routing system, where it can intercept and process requests before they are routed to the appropriate controller or handler.

Customization and Extension: Developers can create custom middleware to implement specific application logic or integrate third-party services. Custom middleware functions can be added to the application's middleware chain to extend its functionality and meet the application's unique requirements.

Overall, middleware plays a crucial role in web development by providing a flexible and extensible mechanism for handling HTTP requests and responses, implementing cross-cutting concerns, and enhancing the functionality and performance of web applications.

### What does `app.use(express.json())` do?
In the context of a Node.js web application using the Express.js framework, app.use(express.json()) is middleware that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.

Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Parsing JSON Requests: When a client sends a POST, PUT, or PATCH request with a JSON payload (i.e., data sent in the request body in JSON format), Express.js needs to parse this JSON data into a JavaScript object that the server-side code can work with.

Middleware Integration: app.use(express.json()) integrates the built-in JSON parsing middleware provided by Express.js into the application's middleware stack. This middleware intercepts incoming requests, checks if they have a JSON payload, and then parses that payload into a JavaScript object, making it accessible via req.body in subsequent route handlers.

Setting Up JSON Parsing Globally: By using app.use(express.json()), you're essentially configuring Express.js to parse JSON data for all incoming requests. This middleware ensures that the request body is parsed as JSON, regardless of the route or endpoint the request is targeting.

### What does the '/:id' mean in a route?

In Express.js, routes can contain parameters that are part of the URL path. These parameters are specified using a colon (:) followed by the parameter name. For example, /users/:id defines a route with a parameter named id.

Here's what /users/:id means:

/users/: This part of the route is static and represents a fixed portion of the URL path. In this case, it indicates that the route is related to users.

:id: This part of the route is a parameter placeholder. It signifies that there can be a dynamic value after /users/, and this value will be captured as the id parameter. The :id syntax indicates that this part of the route can be replaced by any value, such as 123, abc, or any other string.

For example, if a client makes a GET request to /users/123, Express.js will match this route to /users/:id, and it will capture 123 as the value of the id parameter. This parameter can then be accessed within route handlers using req.params.id.

### What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?
PUT and PATCH are both HTTP methods used for updating resources on the server, but they have different semantics and usage patterns:

PUT:

The PUT method is used to update or replace an existing resource with a new version. It essentially performs a full update of the resource.
When you send a PUT request, you provide the entire resource representation in the request payload. The server then replaces the existing resource with the new representation provided.
If the resource already exists, PUT requests typically update the resource entirely. If the resource does not exist, PUT requests may create a new resource at the specified URI.
PUT requests are idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times should have the same effect as making it once.
PATCH:

The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource. It is typically used when you want to update only certain fields or properties of a resource without affecting the rest.
When you send a PATCH request, you provide a set of instructions or changes to be applied to the resource in the request payload. The server then applies these changes to the existing resource.
PATCH requests are not necessarily idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times may have different effects if the server state changes between requests.
PATCH requests are useful when you want to minimize the amount of data transferred over the network by only sending the changes that need to be applied.
In summary, the main difference between PUT and PATCH is in the scope of the update operation. PUT is used for full updates, where you replace the entire resource, while PATCH is used for partial updates, where you apply changes to specific parts of the resource.

### What does a 500 error status code mean?
A 500 Internal Server Error is an HTTP status code that indicates an unexpected condition occurred on the server, preventing it from fulfilling the request made by the client. It's a generic error message that doesn't provide specific details about the nature of the problem.

Here are some key points about the 500 error status code:

Server-Side Error: The 500 error indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from processing the request. This could be due to various reasons such as a bug in the server-side code, database errors, misconfiguration, or issues with third-party services.

No Client-Side Fault: Unlike client-side errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request), where the problem lies with the request made by the client, the 500 error indicates that the issue is on the server-side, and the client's request was valid.

Generic Error Message: The 500 status code doesn't provide specific details about the nature of the problem, as it's intended to be a generic catch-all error message. It's primarily meant to notify the client that something went wrong on the server, without divulging sensitive information that could aid potential attackers.

Debugging and Troubleshooting: When encountering a 500 error, developers typically need to check server logs, monitor system resources, and debug server-side code to identify and resolve the underlying issue. The error message returned to the client may be supplemented with additional information in server logs for debugging purposes.

User Experience Impact: From a user experience perspective, encountering a 500 error can be frustrating for users, as it indicates that the requested action couldn't be completed due to server-side issues. Providing a friendly error message or a custom error page can help improve user experience in such cases.

Overall, the 500 Internal Server Error status code indicates that something unexpected occurred on the server, necessitating further investigation and resolution by developers or system administrators to restore normal functionality.

### What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?

The difference between a status code 200 and a status code 201 lies in their semantic meanings within the context of HTTP responses:

Status Code 200 (OK):

The 200 status code is a standard response for successful HTTP requests. It indicates that the server successfully processed the request and returned the requested resource.
This status code is commonly used for various types of requests, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to indicate that the operation was successful.
In the case of a GET request, a 200 status code indicates that the requested resource is present and the server successfully responded with it.
Status Code 201 (Created):

The 201 status code indicates that the request has been fulfilled and resulted in the creation of a new resource on the server.
It is typically used in response to POST requests to indicate that a new resource has been successfully created as a result of the request.
Along with the 201 status code, the server often includes a Location header in the response, specifying the URI of the newly created resource.
This status code is commonly used in RESTful APIs and web services when creating new resources, such as adding a new entry to a database or creating a new user account.
In summary, while both status codes signify successful outcomes of HTTP requests, a status code 200 indicates that the requested resource is present and accessible, while a status code 201 specifically denotes the successful creation of a new resource on the server.
